SleekPubsub is an XMPP Publish-Subscribe implementation that aims to be a creative and flexible solution to your publish-subscribe needs.
SleekPubsub implements a XEP-0060 interface, an HTTP RESTful interface, a XEP-0050 (Ad Hoc Commands) interface, and a bot/chat interface.

Unusual Features
----------------
- many node types -- start by overriding leaf and create your own behavior
- <body xmlns='jabber:client' /> payloads can optionally create chat IM without pubsub payload.
- subscribe to the component and it can automatically subscribe you to a node
- subscribe to a node and the full jid that you subscribe to can be the source of all of your updates, rather than the bare component jid

RESTful Interface
-----------------
All HTTP calls are protected with http-auth which is configured in the ini [rest] section

So far:

GET		/default/
	get the default config in json

POST	/node/[node]
	create or reconfigure node w/ config via json

GET		/node/[node]
	retrieve config in json

DELETE	/node/[node]
	remove a node

GET		/subscribe/[node]?jid=[jid]
	subscribe a jid to node

GET		/unsubscribe/[node]?jid=[jid]&subid=[subscription id]
	unsubscribe a jid from a node

POST	/publish/[node]
	publish to a node via xml body

GET		/affiliation/[node]
	get node affiliations

POST	/affiliations/[node]
	update node affiliations

**NOTE: POSTS needs to be content-type of text/json or text/xml
