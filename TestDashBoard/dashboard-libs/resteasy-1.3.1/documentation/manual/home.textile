h1. About

The RESTEasy Play! module allows you to define JAX-RS RESTful web services in the Play! Framework using RESTEasy.
Usage

Download and install the RESTEasy Play! module and add the following to your conf/application.conf:

bc. module.resteasy=.../resteasy-play-module
# This is the default path prefix for RESTEasy services
# resteasy.path=/rest

Then start writing JAX-RS resources which will be located at /rest/hello:

bc. @Path("/hello")
public class Hello {
 
 @GET
 public String get(){
  return "Hello World\\n";
 }
 
}
